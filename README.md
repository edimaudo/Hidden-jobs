# Hidden-jobs

## About
A tool for students about jobs outside of the main stream job market

## Approach
The goal was to find something that would be helpful and approachable to students.  The design was kept simple so that students can get to the information as quickly as possible.  The app was built using html, css and javascript and then deployed to vercel.
